# MPDesign
MPDesign is a tool that supports the design of manufacturing processes as part of a Manufacturing Process Management System. 
The tool helps collecting information on task requirements in terms of abilities and authorizations needed to perform these tasks, as well as the expected inputs and produced outputs of tasks. This information is cross-checked with information on the available human and robotic agents, which are potential actors for the tasks. The outcomes of the analysis can be exported and easily used in executable MPMS process models. They also provide immediate insights into the availability of resources and quality aspects of manufacturing processes. This allows factory managers to assign workers to tasks fitting their qualifications, allocate robotic agents to tasks which may be harmful to humans, and properly plan upskilling of the personnel. At the same time, the tool verifies integrity of the modelled process by analyzing completeness of inputs and outputs and their proper flow.
